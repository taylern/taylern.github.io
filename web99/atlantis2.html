        <h1>Atlantis Found! Again.</h1>
        <div id="dsc">
            <p>Atlantis, a destroyed 'lost continent' in the Atlantic Ocean, is now generally acknowledged to have been a myth created by the Greek philosopher Plato*, used as a teaching tool. This has not stopped several people over the centuries from claiming to have discovered the true location of this hypothetical culture. Often, these theories are based in real places and real archaeological discoveries and, in at least one case, a misinterpreted wetland ecology experiment.</p>
            <p>Inspired by a conversation on the pseudoarchaeology podcast <i>Archaeological Fantasies</i> (Episode 107: Atlantis in Sardinia with Dr. Emily Holt) this map is intended to use myth to explore real information about some of the earliest known human civilizations. Click on the map markers below for more information about three of these archaeological sites (and one experiment on zooplankton!).

		Welcome! 
		<p class="main">
		I am a student at Fleming College and an aspiring geospatial scientist. 
		This website is intended to host my personal projects, a short description of my qualifications, 
		and eventually a blog with science writing on GIS, climate change, and the natural environment.
		</p>
		<p class="main">
		I am a recent graduate of the Environmental Geoscience and Bioarchaeological Anthropology programs at the University of Western Ontario, 
		and I have previously worked as an environmental planner and a geological consultant. 
		My interest in mapping stems from my interest in combining art and science to analyze and visualize information.

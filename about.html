<h2>Work</h2>
<h3>Geological Consultant</h3>
<h4>Cobalt Power Group ∙ Cobalt, ON</h4>
<p>
  I spent the summer of 2018 conducting field traverses and collecting rock samples to identify mineral extraction targets. 
  I also created digital and paper maps of outcrops and sample locations. 
  I worked with management to develop proper field and lab safety plans. 
</p> 

<h3>NSERC Undergraduate Research Fellowship</h3>
<h4>University of Western Ontario ∙ London, ON</h4>
<p>
  As part of a research position at the University of Western Ontario, I created models analyzing flooding extents and earthquake ground motions 
  to assess multiple hazard impacts in an urban river environment. This involved work integrating models in ArcGIS and basic geodatabase editing. 
</p> 

<h3>Environmental Planner Co-op</h3>
<h4>Hydro One Networks Inc. ∙ Toronto, ON</h4>
<p>
  During an internship in Environmental Planning, I was responsible for reviewing and updating corporate procedures and data for species at risk, 
  digitizing and georeferencing habitat restoration maps, and conducting research to support environmental planning projects. I reviewed consultant proposals, 
  crafted stakeholder communications, and created a Class Environmental Assessment Screening Report for a transformer station expansion.

<h2>Education</h2>
<h3>BSc Honors Specialization in Environmental Geoscience, Major in Bioarchaeology</h3>
<h4>University of Western Ontario ∙ London, ON</h4>
<p>
	My undergraduate degree consisted of a wide variety of experiences, including GIS spatial analysis, laboratory 
	research in stable isotopes and their applications to paleoclimate and archaeology, and field camps (geophysics, mapping, restoration ecology).
